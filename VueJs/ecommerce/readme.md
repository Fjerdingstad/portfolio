My first Vuejs project and an introduction to Vuejs and Sass.
A lot of Sass customisation and use of Vuejs to make a light and clean product listing website. (The products being comic like faces I created).
The product is structured using Views, Components and the Vue-Router, organised to make have lighter files.
The Data is fetched from a local JSON file in an "API" folder.

A carousel script for a dynamic way of showing different products.
In the "popular" section, the faces's images, name, description and prices are fetched from an API. They are automatically aligned thanks to Sass and shown with Data bindings.

<i>visage productlist.png:</i> </br>
The product listing page, where the faces are fetched from the API like in the home page.

Feel free to check the "src" folder for close inspection of the codes.
